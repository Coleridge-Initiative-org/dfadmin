Dear {{ first_name }},

Welcome to the Administrative Data Research Facility!

Please find instructions for setting up your account and accessing the {{ system_name }} below.

{% if otp_instructions %}
The {{ system_name }} uses two-factor authentication for additional security. You'll need to install an one-time password (OTP) application to your mobile device.

 1. Download DUO Mobile to your phone.
     If you do not have a phone capable of installing DUO Mobile, contact support at support@adrf.zendesk.com.

 2. To set your OneTimePassword and password, enter your username ({{ username }}) here: {{ keycloak_url }}

 You will then be sent a new link in a separate email to complete the following steps.

 3. Follow the new link from step 2 and scan the QR with the app on your mobile device. Enter the 6 digit code into the website and click Submit.

     Note on OneTimePasswords: The important thing to know about these one-time codes is that any given 6 digit code only works for a 30 second window.  DUO Mobile represents this validity window with a circle that starts out full at 30 seconds and disappears as the time counts towards zero. When the circle has disappeared, that 6 digit code is no longer valid and a new code will be generated.

     If, when you first generate a code, the circle is nearly empty and the time remaining is close to zero, you might want to wait for that code to expire, and just use the next code so that you have a full 30 seconds to get it typed in.


{% else %}
1. Go to {{ keycloak_url }} to request a password reset link. You will receive another email, click on the link.

     Username: {{ username }}

2. Enter a new password and click the Submit button.

If you face any issues, please contact our support at support@adrf.zendesk.com.
