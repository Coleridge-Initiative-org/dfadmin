Dear ADRF user,

As part of the FedRAMP process, our Rules of Behavior need to be re-signed annually and when changes are made.
As we released a new version, please sign them again.

ADRF Rules of Behavior are available at: https://ada.coleridgeinitiative.org/rules-of-behavior

If you don't sign the Rules of Behavior, your ADRF access will be disabled until they're signed.

Thanks!
